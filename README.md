To host the Discord bot, I utilized Replit, a free and user-friendly cloud-based development environment. Replit allows the bot to run 24/7 without interruptions by integrating a web server and uptime monitoring service. This ensures the bot remains online and responsive to user commands, providing continuous engagement for the Discord community
This Python bot enhances the user experience on Discord with an engaging mix of entertainment, creativity, and inspiration, making it an essential tool for community interaction.
